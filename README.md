# -Energy-saved-from-recycling-in-Singapore
Recycling saves energy by reducing or eliminating the need to make materials from scratch? For example, aluminum can manufacturers can skip the energy-costly process of producing aluminum from ore by cleaning and melting recycled cans. Aluminum is classified as a non-ferrous metal.  Singapore has an ambitious goal of becoming a zero-waste nation. The amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has increased seven-fold over the last 40 years. At this rate, Semakau Landfill, Singaporeâ€™s only landfill, will run out of space by 2035. Making matters worse, Singapore has limited land for building new incineration plants or landfills.  The government shared the total energy that the combined recycling efforts have saved every year. In this note we will work on finding the energy saved every year from 2015 to 2019 form the main recycled types.
